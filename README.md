# DISPLAYING_EMOJI_BASED_FACIAL_EXPRESSIONS

There are many different ways to express and communicate our feelings. The two classified ways of communication are verbal and non - verbal. Facial expressions are a great way of communication involving the exchange of wordless intimations.
It has enticed much research attention in the field of computer vision and Artificial intelligence. 
Many kinds of research have been done for grouping these expressions. 
It is chiefly done to acquire the sentiments of humans. In this project, an API can be employed to fetch images from any camera-based application in real time. 
HAAR cascade classifier is employed to extract the image features from the images fetched earlier.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to classify those features into corresponding expressions. And these expressions are then converted to their equivalent emoji, after that these emoji, are get superimposed over the actual face expression as a mask. 
This project can be used to study the different facial expressions that a machine can understand and also it can be used as a filter used in social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, snapchat etc.
